# EyeTracker

This is a final project for my undergrad, based on Python language. It was designed for people who have disabilities 
and are not able to type on a keyboard or handle the touchpad. The algorithm captures the center of user's pupil, so 
that it is possible to use eyes as a mouse. A GUI is also implemented, thus allowing user to communicate with family, friends and caregiver.
